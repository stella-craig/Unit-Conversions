# Unit-Conversions
This is my project to create a unit converter in C.

The goal is to create a conversion program for multiple different types of data.


Files in this repository:

conversions.h - This is the C header file that includes all the function prototypes for the program.

lengthconverter.c - This is a C file that includes all the code for converting user-inputted length data from one type into another.
